# Poker and Game theory with Python

I introduce poker and game theory with Python.

The algorithms we use are CFR, MCCFR and FSP and NFSP ...

The games we play are RPS, Kuhn Poker and Leduc Poker.

<br/>

# Target

To people who want to study poker, game theory by using Python.

<br/>

# Demo

This graph show the result of decreasing exploitability by iterations.

Game is Kuhn Poker and alogrithm is CFR, outcome sampling MCCFR, FSP and NFSP .

# Features

I try to introduing the code politely.

And the games and alogorithms I introduce are abundant.

<br/>

# Comment

Please tell me if there is something careless.
